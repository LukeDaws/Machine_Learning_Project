# Machine_Learning_Project
This is the result of a semester long project for the machine learning (MATH2319) class at RMIT university.

For this course project, I compared three different algorithms that will be used to predict early chronic kidney disease. These algorithms were:

-KNN

-Decision trees

-Random forest

I also do some feature selection and ranking with random forest importance, as well as hyperparameter tuning of the 3 models.

The dataset was in regard to chronic kidney disease and taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

If you are interested in the code I used for this assignment please look at the .ipynb file, unfortunately the plots don't show up in github when looking through it. 

If you would like to look through the entire project please download the .pdf or alternatively open the .ipynb in jupyter notebooks.
