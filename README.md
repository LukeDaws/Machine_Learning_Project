# Machine_Learning_Project
This is the result of a semester long project for the machine learning (MATH2319) class at RMIT university.

For this course project, I compared three different algorithms that will be used to predict early chronic kidney disease. These algorithms were:

-KNN

-Decision trees

-Random forest

I also do some feature selection and ranking with random forest importance, as well as hyperparameter tuning of the 3 models.

The dataset was in regards to chronic kindney disease and taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
